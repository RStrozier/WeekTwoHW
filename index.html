    <h3>Rashida Strozier</h3>
    <p>Born and raised in Ohio, I've set across the globe to over 26 different countries. With a lust for life, I have made it my mission to combine my two passions: politics and travel. Most of my personal projects revolve around these two interconnected world's.
    <br>
    My first project "One World One Girl" was inspired by the many people I met during my solo travels across the world. The question I was asked amoungst almost everyone was "can I follow your travels?" Before being taught how to code professionally, I taught myself how to code to allow my worldwide audience to explore with me!
    <br>
    After my first project, I continued on making several of the other projects listed below. I plan to continue to expand my list of projects as I expand my professional development.</p>
